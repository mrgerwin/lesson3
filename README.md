After Video 3		Math, Functions, and Global Variables

Create an input prompt that will ask customers how many cookies they want.  

Take the integer value that they give you (hopefully they give you an integer) and store it into a variable.  

Make another variable called chocolate chips and set it equal to 7.  

Determine how many chocolate chips you will need for the cookies ordered and print it.  Each cookie needs 7 chocolate chips.  

Determine how many full cookie sheets will be needed to fulfill the order.  12 cookies fit on a cookie sheet.  

Calculate and print how many cookies will not fit in a full sheet.

Determine the total area of the cookies if the radius is 3 in. (Remember this is r*r*pi) When you print this information, add something descriptive to each print statement (for example, “The area of the cookies is 40 inches squared”)

Now change the program so that each cookie requires 5 chips and the radius is 2.5 in.
